    <h3>Exercising</h3>
</p>
<p>There are many ways to Exercise, at home, outside or in a gym! <br>
Exercising is key to staying healthy.<br>
<br>
There are different muscle groups that you can train.<br>
When you workout your muscles get damaged,<br>
 this happens in your muscle fibers in the form of tears,<br>
  tissue will form around the injury increasing
the size of your muscles.<br>
 This is why getting rest is very important.</p>
